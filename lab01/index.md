# Lab 01: Setup

## Lab Goals

 - Install and set up software
 - Write some Rust code

## Differences from the Java version
 - The Java version of this lab includes a crash course on terminal basics and Git practice, but it would be somewhat redundant to include that here.
 - The Java version of this lab uses Java and Intellij, rather than Rust and VSCode.
